I use STM32-F401Re microcontroller for this program.
"ExampleTask2 takes data from Queue2 whenever data is available," -- In this i am assuming "Queue2" is a typo mistake as it is not defined in the problem statement.

This is the output for CASE: if(dataID==0) | Delete ExampleTask2

<img width="326" alt="CASE-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e22a91-b2b3-4950-896b-53fedda5118f" />
Output for CASE: if(DataValue==0) | Increase the Priority of ExampleTask2 by 2 from the value given to it at creation
